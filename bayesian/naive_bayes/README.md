# Naive Bayes Algorithm

A Naive Bayes classifier for TypeScript

## npm modules

* [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv)
* [lodash](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lodash)
* [typescript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typescript)
* [winston](https://www.npmjs.com/package/winston)

## Install npm

Use these steps to install the node modules.

1. First [download and install](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) node version 8.11.3
2. Open the GitBash terminal on the directory of the project.
3. And run the command ```npm install``` or ```npm i```

## Run npm

These are the commands for the node modules script.

* Command ```npm run build``` run the distribution build, the code is uglifyed.
* Command ```npm run server``` run the build script and run the node server.
* Command ```npm start``` run the sever script.
* Command ```npm test``` is not working yet.

## DotEnv

Dotenv is a zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env. 

Create a .env file in the root directory of your project. Add environment-specific variables on new lines in the form of NAME=VALUE. For example:

```
LOG_FILE: mock_log_file
ERROR_LOG_FILE: mock_lof_file
```

## Backlog

* Create tests for the Naive Bayes classifier
